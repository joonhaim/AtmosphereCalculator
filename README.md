##Atmosphere Calculator
Atmosphere Calculator is a simple Java application that calculates atmospheric properties such as temperature, pressure, and density based on a given altitude. The calculator uses standard atmospheric models to perform these calculations for altitudes ranging from sea level to 47,000 meters.

## Features

- Calculate temperature in both Kelvin and Celsius based on altitude.
- Calculate air pressure at a given altitude in Pascals.
- Calculate air density in kg/mÂ³ at various altitudes.
- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.

## How to Use
